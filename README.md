* Create a basic HTML web page.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Make sure to have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
